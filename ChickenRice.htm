<h1>HAINAN CHICKEN SAUCE 1: GINGER-GARLIC SAUCE </h1>
<p>
4-inch piece of ginger, roughly chopped
1 clove garlic
3 tablespoons oil
pinch of salt
Grind the ginger and garlic in a food processor until a paste forms. Heat the oil in a small pot or saucepan. Gently fry the ginger and garlic until aromatic and just lightly caramelized. You want to cook it just until it no longer has that spicy raw flavor of uncooked ginger and garlic. Add salt to taste and transfer to a sauce dish.

<h>HAINAN CHICKEN SAUCE 2: SWEET DARK SOY SAUCE</h1>
<p>
1/3 cup water
3 tablespoons rock sugar (about 3 sizable chunks, or just measure out granulated sugar)
1/3 cup dark soy sauce
Heat the water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly until the sugar dissolves and the liquid thickens into a simple syrup. Add the dark soy sauce, stirring to combine. Transfer to a sauce dish.

<h>HAINAN CHICKEN SAUCE 3: CHILI SAUCE</h1>
<p>
6 fresh red chilies (we used Holland chilies)
3-inch piece of ginger
3 cloves of garlic
½ teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon sugar
The juice of 1 small lime
1 teaspoon rice vinegar (or white vinegar)
3-5 tablespoons chicken broth (from boiling the chicken, or until a saucy consistency is achieved
Grind the chilies, ginger, and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. You will probably have to scrape down the sides of the food processor 1-2 times to ensure everything is ground up evenly. Add the sesame oil, salt, sugar, lime juice, and vinegar to the food processor. Pulse 2-3 times to combine.

Transfer to a small bowl and add chicken broth (what you used to boil the chicken) 1 tablespoon at a time until a saucy consistency is achieved. This is really about your preference too; if you like a thicker paste, add less broth. The broth also helps the sauce come together and adds additional chicken flavor!

I personally like to pour the dark soy sauce and ginger mixture all over my rice, and then eat each bite of chicken with a bit of the flavored rice and chili sauce, but everyone has their preference in terms of how they like to enjoy their Hainanese Chicken rice meal. Make it your own!
